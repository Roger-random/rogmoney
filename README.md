# Rog Money
This project builds my idea of a personal finance app. It is very specifically
tailored for my own preferences and unlikely to be a good fit for anyone else.

## Project Objectives
"What's wrong with [Quicken or other personal finance software]? They seemed
easy to use and have lots of online integration." Yes they do, and that's the
problem.
1. They are focused on being easy to use. I am willing to put in extra effort
for things that aren't worth the time for majority of people and thus not
part of commercial offerings.
2. They have too much online integration. I want to keep my data local.

Because of the desire for local data, this GitHub repository is only part of
the picture. This public repository has only my client-side code.
I plan to run an instance on my home local network with my personal data.
In the unlikely case someone else wants to use it, great, but they'd have to
setup their own database.
